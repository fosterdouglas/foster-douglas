It&#39;s always more important for me to enjoy, celebrate, and highlight notable experiences generally than to arbitrarily rush to play the newest games. </small></i></p><p data-v-56c25c44> For me, 2021 was the year of indie gaming. At the start of the year, I made myself a goal to play 2 indie games per week (or average 2-per-week by the end of the year at least). My definition of indie was loose, but in most cases the games are at least an hour or more in length, generally (but not always) have an &quot;end&quot; state of some sort, and are considered &quot;indie&quot; by the generally accepted definition (not published by a large company, a moderate budget and team size, etc). I achieved the goal just barely, and played 105 total indie games (wow!), although I will say that it didn&#39;t feel like a &quot;difficult&quot; goal to achieve necessarily because of how varied and short the experiences were each week. This gives rise to a &quot;Notable Indies&quot; portion of the list below, which I think will be recurring in future lists. </p><p data-v-56c25c44> And as a result, I played a good amount less &quot;AAA&quot; games in 2021, which was a necessary trade off. Generally speaking, I prefer indie games anyway, so I don&#39;t feel remorse about this. Below are quick blurbs on the notable experiences I had this year. Many of them are incomplete thoughts, or too-late recollections of thoughts I had during the original playthroughs (many months ago for some), but I try to give a general gist of why, to me, it&#39;s worth putting on a list: </p><hr data-v-56c25c44><h2 data-v-56c25c44><mark data-v-56c25c44>Notable Indies</mark></h2><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Ikenfell</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Happy Ray Games</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/ikenfell.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> I played this early in the year, but I remember being wholly charmed by it. It has a unique turn-based combat system that feels like a simplified variation on <i data-v-56c25c44>Paper Mario</i> and <i data-v-56c25c44>Tactics</i> games, and the characters and narrative were memorable and interesting. If I were a kid now, I could even see myself enjoying it as much as I enjoyed <i data-v-56c25c44>Chrono Trigger</i> as a kid (although of course <i data-v-56c25c44>Chrono Trigger</i> is more seminal in every way, that distinction might be subtle to younger audiences). </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Chicory: A Colorful Tale</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Greg Lobanov, Finji</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/chicory-a-colorful-tale.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> This game wears its 2D <i data-v-56c25c44>Zelda</i> inspirations proudly on its sleeve, and in certain aspects it actually succeeds in ways that the 2D <i data-v-56c25c44>Zelda</i> games don&#39;t entirely. Which is to say with its storytelling and emotional heart. It has much less &quot;combat&quot; (but by no means completely absent of conflict and tension), and I love the focus on character interaction and how unique the painting mechanic is. It&#39;s not just another hero carrying a sword and shield, but a vulnerable and grounded protagonist who grows with the player. Weirdly similar to my comment on <i data-v-56c25c44>Ikenfell</i>, I could absolutely see this being an inspirational game for someone younger, and that in the future they would look back fondly on playing it as a child. If the Games of the Year section wasn&#39;t so packed already, this game would have probably made it there. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>TOEM</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Something We Made</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/toem.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> A game all about taking photos. It&#39;s so charming, so easy to play and &quot;cozy&quot; feeling, has a great mix of limited exploration and satisfying collectibles, and the perfect overall length. Pulling off black and white seems so tricky normally but it pulls it off with distinction and is the perfect choice for the game, both visually and conceptually for a game based around photography to focus on composition and reference the roots of the medium. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Alba: A Wildlife Adventure</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Ustwo, Plug In Digital</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/alba-a-wildlife-adventure.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> Another... game all about taking photos. This game hit me in some interesting ways, and I was surprised at how it had a purpose and &quot;mission&quot; beyond the game itself (broadly, it&#39;s about wildlife preservation), and how it gently preaches that mission to the player. It&#39;s also really interesting to play directly as a child, and I don&#39;t think most games that try this really pull it off but here its done with a lot of whimsy and care. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Everything</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>David OReilly</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/everything.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> In some ways, this sometimes barely feels like a &quot;game,&quot; and in other ways I consider it as a contender for best of the year. It&#39;s a great example of effective organic exploration design. It&#39;s also in the rare category of explicitly incorporating philosophy in its narrative, and the even rarer category of that philosophy being delivered directly by Alan Watts. As with all the games in the Games of the Year group, even though this one isn&#39;t, I could absolutely see replaying this some day in the future, if for no other reason than an excuse to listen to a couple of hours of Alan Watts philosophize over top a <i data-v-56c25c44>Katamari</i>-infused universe simulator. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Void Bastards</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Blue Manchu</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/void-bastards.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> It&#39;s hard to pinpoint exactly why I enjoyed this game so much. I do know that all the systems feel exactly as complex as they need to be, and that the gameplay loop is challenging but fair and varied enough to stay interesting for the 10 hours or so it takes to finish a single run. The humor and art style are also spot on. </p><hr data-v-56c25c44><h2 data-v-56c25c44><mark data-v-56c25c44>Notable Strategy</mark></h2><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Desperadoes III</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Mimimi Games</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/desperadoes-3.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> The strategy game design was both satisfyingly open-ended, allowing dozens of solutions to any given area, while also still retaining direction and momentum forward. I found myself often surprised at how creative I could be, and sometimes needed to be, to get through certain sections and accomplish some of the optional goals too. Also surprisingly, the narrative was quite interesting, though not ground-breaking, and felt like a step forward from their previous title, <i data-v-56c25c44>Shadow Tactics</i>. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Into the Breach</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Subset Games</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/into-the-breach.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> From the people that did <i data-v-56c25c44>FTL</i>, this is a thoughtful experience with meticulously designed turn-based strategy and endless variation. I only played through the game once, despite the game heavily encouraging multiple playthroughs. That&#39;s actually my only complaint with the game, that it could have maybe strung together a few sets of the 4 islands to create something more like a standard campaign to play through, instead of individual disconnected runs. Regardless, one of the best modern strategy games I&#39;ve maybe ever played. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Frostpunk</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>11 Bit Studios</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/frostpunk.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> A complex and tense game with a pretty narrow design for viable strategies, but still a lot fun regardless. In particular, the &quot;prequel&quot; DLC that was released was my favorite scenario of the lot because it deviated the most from the rest of the game&#39;s stricter style. I&#39;m glad the game was successful enough to warrant a sequel eventually, which was recently announced. I&#39;m also very excited for the board game adaptation that&#39;s coming. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Slay the Spire</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Mega Crit Games</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/slay-the-spire.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> In the category of &quot;rougelike&quot; games with loads of relics to collect to then use to break the rules, this game lives next to the greatest games of this style like <i data-v-56c25c44>Dead Cells</i> , <i data-v-56c25c44>The Binding of Isaac</i> , and <i data-v-56c25c44>Risk of Rain</i>, except... it&#39;s a card-based strategy game. It&#39;s since paved the way for an entire genre of card-action games (which are distinct from what <i data-v-56c25c44>Hearthstone</i> does, I think). I played it much less than I was tempted to, but I did play through to the end boss with the three primary classes and thoroughly enjoyed its deep mechanics. </p><hr data-v-56c25c44><h2 data-v-56c25c44><mark data-v-56c25c44>Most Addictive</mark></h2><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Planet Coaster</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Fontier Developments</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/planet-coaster.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> This was my Pandemic comfort game, for sure. I put 100 hours into it (generally rare for me for a single game), and really enjoyed creating coasters and micromanaging the aspects of the parks and employees. It feels like an optimized balance loop between strategy and creativity, creating something unique in your park and seeing how that affects the ecosystem and then adapting and doing that process over and over again. It feels like a worthy successor to the <i data-v-56c25c44>Rollercoaster Tycoon</i> series, and is actually a better experience in most ways. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Two Point Hospital</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Two Point Studios</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/two-point-hospital.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> Similarly, this game is clearly inspired by Bullfrog&#39;s classic <i data-v-56c25c44>Theme Hospital</i> from the 90s, a goofy-in-tone but serious-strategy hospital management sim. This game takes that goofy tone even further, which works really well. My only complaint with the experience is that once you realize how important the room decorations that level up each room in the hospital are, it feels like you can get through things a lot easier in ways that maybe didn&#39;t feel intended in the design. I&#39;m definitely looking forward to the team&#39;s university-themed follow-up this year, <i data-v-56c25c44>Two Point Campus</i>. </p><hr data-v-56c25c44><h2 data-v-56c25c44><mark data-v-56c25c44>Notable Co-Op</mark></h2><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Ashen</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>A44</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/ashen.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> During the first boss of this, I was worried that we weren&#39;t cut out for this type of game, but after some practice it ended up being very satisfying. It implements co-op in a nice way, slightly more intuitively than FromSoftware games generally do. The art style and world design is really satisfying and simple, and exploring some of the nooks and crannies of the moderately-sized open world felt rewarding. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Sackboy: A Big Adventure</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Sumo Digital</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/sackboy-a-big-adventure.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> This was a complete joy to play local co-op, and felt like a really nice transition for Sackboy from side-scrolling to 3D adventure. It feels as though a lot of the structural groundwork was laid with <i data-v-56c25c44>Tearaway</i>, although I know a separate developer did most of the work on this entry. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Fallout 76</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Bethesda Softworks</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/fallout-76.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> I consider myself a mild Fallout fan, although I&#39;ve recently realized that I&#39;ve played <i data-v-56c25c44>Fallout 3</i> , <i data-v-56c25c44>New Vegas</i> , <i data-v-56c25c44>Shelter</i> , <i data-v-56c25c44>Fallout 4</i> , and now <i data-v-56c25c44>Fallout 76</i>, so maybe I like the series more than I think I do. I might have had a little more fun with this than Lance did, especially because I did most of the &quot;base building&quot; stuff, which I found a lot of enjoyment with. The game&#39;s narrative builds toward a nice climax and some of the characters are memorable. It&#39;s worth noting that we played this long after it was released, after it had a lot of patches and full-blown content updates that were absent at launch. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Embr</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Muse Games</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/embr.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> Adding this here for the sheer novelty factor of the experience. It was a lot of fun to play as a firefighter with some cartoon whimsy, and have some unique &quot;gadgets&quot; that each firefighter could bring into the field. The boss design was pretty poorly done, but luckily there were only a few bosses anyway. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Operation: Tango</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Clever Plays</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/operation-tango.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> A surprisingly fun asynchronous game where one person plays as an &quot;agent&quot; in the field, while the other person is the tech &quot;hacker&quot; off site. It had really fun puzzles, great overall length, and some very nicely balanced and lenient failure conditions. It created some of the most stressful and hilarious co-op moments of the year, and we actually played through it twice to see both sides of each level. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Heroes of Hammerwatch</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>CrackShell</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/heroes-of-hammerwatch.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> I was very surprised by how addicting the gameplay loop was for this. A given &quot;run&quot; had an interesting difficulty curve that goes from Easy &gt; Difficult &gt; Very Difficult &gt; Easy, if you can find enough interesting artifacts along the way. It feels very well suited for co-op as well, playing it single player seems a lot less dynamic and interesting. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Nioh 2</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Team Ninja</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/nioh-2.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> Pretty much an improvement in every way over the first Nioh. One of the few games available at 120fps on PS5 near launch, it has some beautiful environments and is incredibly silky smooth. It&#39;s always interesting to dive into these games with complex systems that take some time to fully understand, and generally it pays off later on. We enjoyed it enough to play the three DLCs as well. </p><hr data-v-56c25c44><h2 data-v-56c25c44><mark data-v-56c25c44>Most Surprising</mark></h2><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Tearaway Unfolded</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Media Molecule</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/tearaway-unfolded.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> This has all the charm of a Media Molecule <i data-v-56c25c44>Littlebigplanet</i> entry, but as a third-person adventure story. I&#39;m not sure why I was so surprised by this, but the game had an incredible amount of creativity in how it used the PS4&#39;s controller, and how it incorporates the &quot;You&quot; (the player) into the game in interesting meta ways. Although the game was about twice as long as it needed to be for my taste, all of it still feels fresh and innovative throughout. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Square Enix</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/dq-11s.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> Having never played a <i data-v-56c25c44>DQ</i> game and sort of insinuating what they&#39;d be like based on some random impressions, this game was a massive surprise to me (although it may be the case that it is the least <i data-v-56c25c44>Dragon Quest</i>-like entry in the series). The production value, and in particular the music, is astonishing. It tries a lot of unique things and succeeds with most of them, and it really feels like a nice evolution or hybridization of a classic JRPG. </p><hr data-v-56c25c44><h2 data-v-56c25c44><mark data-v-56c25c44>Most Disappointing</mark></h2><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>The Pathless</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Giant Squid</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/the-pathless.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> I know that this game is beloved by a lot of fans, and I can definitely see why, but to me the game design feels ham-fisted and disjointed. The open world is beautiful and moving through it fluidly and &quot;flow&quot;-like feels really special. The decision to then make it into an Ubisoft-style &quot;activate the towers&quot; game design is a bit disappointing, but not what soiled the experience for me. It&#39;s the boss design that feels unnecessary (although I&#39;ve seen plenty of discourse heavily praising it). It doesn&#39;t feel like it fits with the vibe of the world, almost as if an executive came in at the end of development and said &quot;this is great, but you know what it&#39;s missing? BOSSES.&quot; So much else about the game is experimental that I feel they could have leaned even harder into it to better tie it all together for me. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Sayonara Wild Hearts</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Simogo</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/sayonara-wild-hearts.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> Outside of all of the unfortunate controversy around the development team on this game, which sullies its appeal as it is, I came away after playing it with a weird mix of inspired and frustrated. My primary issue with the gameplay is that it doesn&#39;t encourage experimentation. The game has a notable and stellar soundtrack, and the game feels at its best when the player can get into a flow with the music and traverse the levels. But, with such strict level design in some cases, you&#39;ll find yourself replaying sections of levels over and over to get past them. While there&#39;s nothing wrong with that in theory, being restarted at checkpoints feels deeply at odds with the flow of the gameplay style. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Maquette</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Graceful Decay</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/maquette.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> It&#39;s easy to sum this up, which is to say a very cool idea executed a bit poorly. It&#39;s more focused on telling a (heartfelt, for sure) sob-story about a breakup someone had than it is concerned with the puzzle-designed experience of the player, unfortunately. If this type of game is interesting to you, check out <i data-v-56c25c44>Superliminal</i>, <i data-v-56c25c44> Manifold Garden</i>, or <i data-v-56c25c44>The Pedestrian</i>, just a few of many great games in the puzzle genre that I played in 2021. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Raji: An Ancient Epic</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Nodding Head Games</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/raji-an-ancient-epic.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> Unfortunately, this experience didn&#39;t quite come together for me. The controls and combat design are incredibly frustrating, to the extreme that it felt borderline unplayable at times personally. The visuals are great, and the story-telling style and setting are quite unique and distinct, but neither is enough to carry the entire experience. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Outer Wilds: Echoes of the Eye</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Mobius Digital, Annapurna Interactive</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/outer-wilds-echoes-of-the-eye.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> This doesn&#39;t technically belong in this section, but I had such a polarizing experience with Outer Wilds&#39; DLC that it&#39;s worth pointing out. The first hour or two of this 8+-hour DLC was mind-blowing and somehow manages to up the ante on what was one of the best games I&#39;ve ever played as is. Unfortunately (for me), it soon devolves into a (admittedly well-designed) horror-survival experience, in ways that the original game never even came close to being. It was soon obvious to me that there was no way I was going to enjoy getting through the experience, so I watched a playthrough of it instead. There is so much positive to say about this expansion, and there are three distinct &quot;oh my gosh&quot; revelations which each one-up the other in ways that are so incredible and inspiring and unforgettable. There is absolutely a reality where this game could have had a mode without the aspect that made it survival-horror, but I do believe I&#39;m the minority in this opinion as most online discourse seems to enjoy the specific mechanic I felt frustrated by. </p><hr data-v-56c25c44><h2 data-v-56c25c44><mark data-v-56c25c44>Games of My Year</mark></h2><p data-v-56c25c44> Generally speaking, my criteria for GOTY is pretty loose, although one common theme that I personally have noticed is: if by the end of a given experience I am thinking &quot;I can&#39;t wait to play this again someday&quot; then there&#39;s a good chance it belongs in this list. This is particularly true because I personally very rarely replay games. I also try not to limit this list to any specific length (because, well, some years you just play a lot of great games), while also trying to resist the temptation to just put 15+ games here. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Disco Elysium</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Robert Kurvitz</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/disco-elysium-1.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> There is way more to say about this game than I could ever conjure into words. It really feels like it speaks for itself entirely. Every moment is packed with emotion and dripping with style, and it is so consistent with itself that it feels almost like it was birthed whole-cloth as a single entity. </p><p data-v-56c25c44> The city the game takes place in, and the exposed lore of the world that this city lives amongst, and all of its people and their place in that world all feel so real. Every &quot;quest&quot; you come across never feels as such, but just another person in this world living their life and integrating you into it in the ways that they feel like doing. It&#39;s also worth noting that I generally dislike the &quot;amnesia&quot; main protagonist trope, but this game builds its entire premise and plot on it which makes it feel believable and worthy. It also can&#39;t be overstated how impactful the soundtrack is in <i data-v-56c25c44>Disco Elysium</i>. It is another character in the story and the world, it ties everything together, and it makes you feel everything Harry feels. </p><img src="./images/gomy2021/disco-elysium-2.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> In my opinion, this might be one of the best games ever crafted, and it will no doubt go down in the annals of history as a seminal classic of interactive fiction and creativity. I can&#39;t wait to play it again some day and explore the hundreds of decisions and options I didn&#39;t stumble across the first time around. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Returnal</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Housemarque</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/returnal-1.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been as deeply immersed in a game as I was with <i data-v-56c25c44>Returnal</i>. From a flow-state gameplay perspective absolutely, but also as a can&#39;t-stop-thinking-about-it brain worm life feeling (coincidentally though, <i data-v-56c25c44>Disco Elysium</i> may be the only other game I&#39;ve ever played that gave me that same feeling). I finished the experience across 6 intensely condensed days of playing, and there was once that I think I launched and played the game 4 separate times in a single day (admittedly for shorter sessions each, but its worth noting how unlike me it is to do this). The world immersion and the extreme precision and care put into the game design flow itself mostly contributed to my not being able to stop thinking about it. </p><img src="./images/gomy2021/returnal-2.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> After such wonderful gameplay systems and world design, everything else about the game feels like icing on the cake. The particle effect design, the ear-candy sound design, the creature models, the random-but-not-too-random level generation, and the punishing-but-forgiving-enough play loop to name a few. Then it&#39;s all capped off beautifully by its what-the-hell-is-going-on narrative and our main protagonist&#39;s great voice work. I didn&#39;t get the true &quot;Act 3&quot; ending, but I&#39;ll likely revisit the game in a few years and see that conclusion through. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Mutazione</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Die Gute Fabrik</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/mutazione.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> This game embodies so many of the reasons I play games. Games that allow us to escape to different worlds, with their own problems but also their own beauties that our own world can&#39;t have. Games that let us become somebody we aren&#39;t (in this case, a teenage girl going on a coming-of-age summer vacation trip to an irradiated fallout island full of quirky mutated humans...). Games that give us feelings and connections we can&#39;t otherwise find in our day-to-day lives. Games that create a space for us to laugh or cry or think or just be and feel. Games that manifest meaning from nothing, carefully weaving together an intricate pattern of sound and visual and text with interaction. Mutazione accomplishes all of this and so much more, and all with some beautifully simple gameplay mechanics. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>&quot;DEATHLOOP&quot;</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Arkane Studios</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/deathloop.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> I expected this game to be much more like &quot;<i data-v-56c25c44>Dishonored</i> but with a time-loop&quot; than it ends up being in reality. To be fair, it shares so many elements with <i data-v-56c25c44>Dishonored</i> , so I can see why I might have thought that. But, the entire structure, tone, and even much of the moment-to-moment gameplay, is quite different. The DNA though is clearly there, and the level design is unquestionably descendent. And let&#39;s be honest, the level design is the shining star of the <i data-v-56c25c44>Dishonored</i> franchise anyway. </p><p data-v-56c25c44> It&#39;s well established online why everybody thinks so highly of this game, and it&#39;s all spot on. The world design is distinctive, and the cast of characters are quite memorable despite the player interacting directly with some of them very infrequently. It all feels so well realized and consistent with its bizarre and captivating sci-fi premise. My experience overall felt complete, so I may never actually revisit this game&#39;s campaign, but I loved my time with it and I could see them doing some DLC for it which would be a welcome addition. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Manifold Garden</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>William Chyr Studio</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/manifold-garden.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> The mind-bending visuals of this game are enough to set it apart from many other games, but the puzzle design and bizarre avant-garde approach to story telling elevate it further. It&#39;s the rare case where I actually feel as though I&#39;m playing as myself in this game, as it makes no effort to give the game&#39;s avatar any story, context, or personality. It&#39;s a direct connection between me and the game, facilitated through an interactive first-person camera control. </p><p data-v-56c25c44> Experiencing <i data-v-56c25c44>Manifold Garden</i> gave me the same feeling that you might get from an indie film, one that you feel is so quirky or specific or meaningful that it could have only been created specifically for you. The game expresses itself in such an experimental way, and entirely succeeds at making you think about things you never expected to think about from a game with no text or explicit narrative. </p><hr data-v-56c25c44><h2 data-v-56c25c44><mark data-v-56c25c44>Honorable Mentions</mark></h2><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Control</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Remedy Entertainment</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/control.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> Jesse is such a well-written character and the world of Control is such an interesting blend of so many sci-fi tropes and still emerges as something completely distinct. Even a year after playing it, I still remember the names of the characters and a lot of the specifics of what happens in the story. It also feels like a really meaningful evolution of the &quot;documents&quot; and &quot;audio logs&quot; trope that a lot of these games fall into; it never feels like those items scattered about are &quot;lore dump&quot; but are a very meaningful way of world building. I can&#39;t wait to see what Remedy does next, although I don&#39;t imagine I&#39;ll be playing the suspense-turned-horror Alan Wake 2, unfortunately. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Diablo II: Resurrected</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Blizzard Entertainment, Vicarious Visions</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/diablo-2-resurrected.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> I played this once through with my brother, and can say that the team that Blizzard gave this to for the remastering treatment did great with it. I could see going back to this again with others or to play through on the harder difficulties. It&#39;s fittingly so that the best thing Blizzard has put out in quite a while is a remake of their pièce de résistance from 20 years ago. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Insomniac Games</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/marvels-spider-man-miles-morales.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> This sequel improved upon everything from the original in my opinion, and will go down certainly as the best &quot;launch&quot; title for the PS5 generation. It felt significantly more focused than the first (as in, many less collectibles), which I prefer in general in these open world games. More like <i data-v-56c25c44>Horizon: Zero Dawn</i> (or <i data-v-56c25c44>Breath of the Wild</i> maybe) and less like <i data-v-56c25c44>Assassin&#39;s Creed</i> is always what I prefer. The story was just as good, and although the game length was much shorter, I almost always prefer compact and focused narrative experiences that players can and do actually finish. </p><h4 class="bold" data-v-56c25c44>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim</h4><h6 data-v-56c25c44>Vanillaware</h6><img src="./images/gomy2021/13-sentinels-aegis-rim.gif" data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44> A truly bizarre and memorable sci-fi experience. The flow between the narrative and strategy sections never quite hit the mark for me, but overall the writing and the world they create manages to be both referential to many Japanese tropes while also feeling fresh and self-aware. </p><hr data-v-56c25c44><p data-v-56c25c44><i class="small" data-v-56c25c44> (Because it&#39;s an absolute pain to get images off of the PS5, all GIF images on this page are taken from Google and belong to their respective original owners!) </i></p></div><div class="col-md-auto" data-v-56c25c44></div></div><!--]--><div class="text-center w-100 pb-1 mt-5 writingFont" style="bottom:50px;"> Made with love (and Nuxt3) by me! ©2023 <br><a class="back" href="https://twitter.com/_fosterdouglas" target="_blank">twitter </a> / <a class="back" href="https://sandcastle.co" target="_blank">sandcastle.co </a> / <a class="back" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/foster-douglas/" target="_blank">linkedin </a></div></div></main><div class="position-absolute" style="left:calc(50vw - 25px);"><a href="/foster-douglas/" class="router-link-active text-decoration-none" tag="div"><span class="supportFont back large"><</span></a></div><!--]--><!--]--><!--]--><!--]--></div><script type="module">import p from "/foster-douglas/gomy2021/_payload.js";window.__NUXT__={...p,...({state:{},_errors:{},serverRendered:true,prerenderedAt:1683741034708,config:{public:{},app:{baseURL:"\u002Ffoster-douglas\u002F",buildAssetsDir:"\u002F_nuxt\u002F",cdnURL:""}}})}</script><script type="module" src="/foster-douglas/_nuxt/entry.446b2484.js" crossorigin></script></body>
